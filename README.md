- Receive validation errors if:
  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

## My process

### Built with


- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- TailwindCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow




### What I learned

Well, this project required a lot of thinking and libraries to manage dates, such as MomentJS. So in this challenge, I expand my knowledge of how to work efficiently with dates, states, objects, etc. in addition, working with ReactJS and Tailwind was helpful in the project because these are very important tools that are I needed to build a calendar for the project. These tools helped me to create a user-friendly interface quickly and efficiently


### Continued development

I found working with dates has different challenges, that's why I found really useful the MomentJS library. It's a great help to manage and manipulate dates and times. It's very easy to use and makes the process of managing dates much simpler. It also provides useful methods to format dates and validate them. It's something I want to keep working on in the future.
